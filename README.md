# Valorant-Insta-Locker
Simple python script to lock in any agent in valorant faster than your teammates.

### Usage:
1. Have the script open when queing for a valorant match.
2. Recommended to have valorant in windowed display mode so that it is easier to switch back and forth.
  - There is a button to toggle display mode. 
3. Click on the icon of the agent you want to lock in.
4. As you are loading into the match, hold `'W'` to activate the script.
  - Release `'W'` when you lock in the agent.
5. Press `'Q'` if you want to switch agents. (if you don't it bugs out)
