# Valorant-Insta-Locker
Simple python script to lock in any agent in valorant faster than your teammates.

## Usage
- Have the script open when queing for a valorant match.
- Recommended to have valorant in windowed display mode so that it is easier to switch back and forth.
  - There is a button to toggle display mode. 
- Click on the icon of the agent you want to lock in.
- As you are loading into the match, hold `'W'` to activate the script.
  - Release `'W'` when you lock in the agent.
- Press `'Q'` if you want to switch agents. (It bugs out if you don't)
